1) Used separate table objects for income and expenses.
2) For totals in both tables, I have used the inbuilt Excel table total feature.
3) Used conditional formatting to highlight monthly savings when they are below the monthly savings target that is specified at the top.
4) I have added the additional income and expense items. Also, filled out the own real expenses in this sheet on an ongoing basis
